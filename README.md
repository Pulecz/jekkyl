## Welcome to pulecz's GitHub Pages

This repo contains markdown files I want to host somewhere.
GitHub Pages are using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) (Ruby based) to process the markdown files to html.

There are many other options, such as [Pelican](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/) (Python based), which I didn't explored yet.
